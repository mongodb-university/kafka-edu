# MongoDB Connector for Apache Kafka Tutorials

*NOTE: These tutorials are currently under development.  Check the [MongoDB.com blog site](https://www.mongodb.com/blogs) for a formal announcement when completed in CY21.*

The official MongoDB Connector for Apache® Kafka® is developed and supported by MongoDB engineers and verified by Confluent. The Connector is designed to be used with Kafka Connect and enables MongoDB to be a datasource for Apache Kafka from both a source and sink perspective.

These tutorials are focused on teaching you the essential features and functionality of the connector enabling you to get up and running quickly.  

Each tutorial is located in a subdirectory on this repository.  All tutorials will leverage the Docker environment found in the root folder in this repository.  To work through any of the tutorials read the README file within each folder to get started.

# Prerequisites

The tutorials use the following client applications:

- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
- [KafkaCat](https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Mongosh](https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/install/)

You can install them locally first before starting tutorials.  Alternatively, there is a Docker image, "tutoralshell" that will be created and available once you start the environment.  This image contains all the tools installed in an Ubuntu image.

# Starting the Docker environemnt

To start the baseline tutorial environemnt execute the shell script `run.sh`.
```sh run.sh```

> Note: If you are using a Windows OS, execute the `run.ps1` script a Powershell environment.

This shell script will stand up the following Docker environment:

- MongoDB replica set
- Apache Kafka Bootstrap
- Apache Kafka Broker
- Apache Kafka Connect
- Tutorialshell

Once the environment is running, use the `status.h` script to confirm the setup and configuration of this tutorial environment.
`sh status.h`

> Note: If you are using a Windows OS, execute the `status.ps1` script a Powershell environment.

If you do not have the tools installed locally as described in the prerequisites, you can run through the tutorials using the TutorialShell image.  

```docker run --rm --name shell1 --network kafka-edu_localnet -it tutorialshell:0.1 bash```

Note: For some of the tutorials you might need to have more than one shell window open.  In that scenario just remember to give a unique name for the "--name" parameter such as "shell1", "shell2", etc.

## Tutorials

The following is a list of available tutorials:


| Tutorial      | Description | Link |
| :---        |    :----   | :----   |
| 1 - Getting Started      |  Learn how to move data between Kafka and MongoDB      | [Tutorial 1]() |
| 2- Converters and Transforms   | Coming Soon        | |
| 3- Selective Replication   | Explore replicating data between MongoDB clusters through Kafka using the ChangeStreamEvent handler        | [Tutorial 3]() |
| 4- Using Schemas   | Coming Soon        | |
| 4- Error Handling   | Coming Soon        | |

## Shutting down the Tutorial environment

The Docker environemnt can be stopped using
`docker-compose down`

If you would like to drop the MongoDB databases as well as shutdown use
`docker-compose down -v`

To start the environment again just execute the `run.sh` shell script
`sh run.sh`
> Note: If you are using a Windows OS, execute the `run.ps1` script a Powershell environment.
