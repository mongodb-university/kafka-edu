# Unsupported Connector Version

The [MongoDB Kafka Connector Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/kafka-connector/current/)
quick start and tutorials do not support v1.2 of the connector. The quick start and tutorials depend on the
`change.data.capture.handler` feature of the connector. The connector supports
the `change.data.capture.handler` feature in v1.4 and later.
