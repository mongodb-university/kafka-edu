# Unsupported Connector Version

The [MongoDB Kafka Connector Documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/kafka-connector/current/)
quick start and tutorials do not support v1.0 of the connector. The quick start and tutorials depend on the Change Data Capture Handler
feature of the connector which is available in the connector v1.4 and later.
