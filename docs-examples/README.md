# This is where the sample pipelines for Docs Examples live

**DO NOT EDIT THE FILES IN THE `built_examples` DIRECTORY, EDIT THE FILES IN THE SOURCE DIRECTORY**

To build the sample pipelines, run the following commands from within the
`docs-examples` directory:

    pip install pipenv

    pipenv shell

    python build.py
