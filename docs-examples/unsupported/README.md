# Unsupported Connector Version

The [MongoDB Kafka Connector Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/kafka-connector/current/)
quick start and tutorials do not support MONGODB_KAFKA_CONNECTOR_VERSION of the connector. The quick start and tutorials depend on the Change Data Capture Handler
feature of the connector which is available in the connector v1.4 and later.
